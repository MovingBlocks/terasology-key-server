# This file contains the default settings for running the application with Docker-compose.
# To override the settings it's not necessary to edit this file: all values can be overridden with environment variables.
# For example, you can start the application with this command: HTTP_MODE=redirectToHttpsConfiguredPort RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=mykey RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=mysecret docker-compose up
# More information about .env files: https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/

# Path to the directory on the host machine to store database backups in
DB_BACKUP_VOLUME=./db-dumps

# File name of backup to restore when the database container is initialized, if any (must be the full name of a file in the backup volume, should be in the form backup_<datetime>.sql). If empty, the database will be initialized empty.

# HTTP and HTTPS listen ports (used by the webapp container and mapped to the host)
HTTP_PORT=80
HTTPS_PORT=443

# Set to false to disable HTTPS (HTTPS_PORT will be ignored and server will only listen on HTTP_PORT)
HTTPS_ENABLED=true

# These need to be overriden if you want to use your custom SSL certificate (which you probably want if HTTPS is enabled). Set HTTPS_CERT_VOLUME to the path of the host machine where the certificate files are stored, and HTTPS_KEYFILE and HTTPS_CERTFILE, respectively, to the file names of the key and of the certificate. For example, if the files on the host machine are /etc/my_certificates/mycert.key and /etc/my_certificates/mycert.pem, you would need to set HTTPS_CERT_VOLUME=/etc/my_certificates HTTPS_KEYFILE=mycert.key and HTTPS_CERTFILE=mycert.pem

# HTTP handling mode - the following values are allowed:
# preserveHttp: keep the HTTP connections HTTP, no redirection.
# redirectToHttpsConfiguredPort: redirect HTTP connections to the specified HTTPS port.
# redirectToHttpsDefaultPort: redirect HTTP connections to the default HTTPS port (443). Users will just see https://site instead of https://site:443 in the browser address bar, but will only work if HTTPS_PORT is set to 443
HTTP_MODE=preserveHttp

# reCAPTCHA keys - if empty, the default test keys will be used (be sure to override in production!)

# and the mail server is not reachable from outside the network build by docker-compose) so overriding them is not necessary but you can if you want.
# MAIL_PASSWORD is not used if an external SMTP server is used (i.e. you are using the docker-compose-externalMail.yml file)

# These are only used if you choose to use an external SMTP server for outgoing mail instead of a local server in it's docker container.
# To do this, you need to use the docker-compose-externalMail.yml file (i.e. run "docker-compose up -f docker-compose-externalMail.yml" instead of simply "docker-compose up"); these variables are ignored by the default docker-compose.yml file.
